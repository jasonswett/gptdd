## Introduction

GPTDD aims to facilitate the TDD process by integrating with ChatGPT. It allows developers to write tests and code based on requirements given to ChatGPT. GPTDD then updates the codebase accordingly, running the relevant tests until they pass.

## Installation

Clone the GPTDD repository from GitHub:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonswett/gptdd.git
\`\`\`

After cloning the repository, follow the instructions in the setup section to configure your environment.

## Usage

Before starting to use GPTDD, paste the contents of the prompts/instructions.txt file into ChatGPT.

Follow the TDD workflow outlined in the instructions:

1. Provide a requirement to ChatGPT.
2. Receive test code from ChatGPT.
3. Copy and paste the test code into GPTDD.
4. GPTDD updates the codebase and runs the relevant tests.
5. Repeat the process until the tests pass.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the prompts/instructions.txt file.
