Write a README for GPTDD.
Give it to me in a format that's easy to copy and paste.
Mention near the top that the README was written mostly by ChatGPT.

In the usage section, mention that you have to paste prompts/instructions.txt into ChatGPT before starting.

Also, the URL for GPTDD is https://github.com/jasonswett/gptdd.git.
